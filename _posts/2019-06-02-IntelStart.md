title: "Starting at Intel"
---

Tomorrow marks the start of my second week at Intel. The internship has been going really well! Python is a bit different than I'm used to, but it's not a difficult transition. It's been really cool being a part of a team and having meetings almost everyday. I can see why people generally don't like code reviews, but it's been a fun but somewhat frustrating challenge having a conversation with my co-workers about my code. I have four JIRAs open to work on so I work on one and submit it for code review and then switch gears to another JIRA and return when I get feedback on the previous.
