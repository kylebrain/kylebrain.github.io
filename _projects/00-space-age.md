Unity C# game made at the 2019 Biggest Little Hackathon. I took more of a project management and version control head than a programmer but I worked mainly on the controls and gunning mechanics when coding. The goal of the game is to shoot down enemy ships. One player can control the ship and the other controls the guns. Damage to the ships will damage sub-systems such as shields and navigation which hinder the overall preformance of the ship. Either player can disengage from their current task to repair the sub-systems and get the ship back to its full potential.
