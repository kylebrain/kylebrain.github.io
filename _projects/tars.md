Designed for the Navy, the Target Angle Recognition Software (TARS) tests the user's ability to identify ship types, angles, and light statuses.
Written in C# in Unity, TARS is fully VR integrated which allows for further immersion and learning for user. Two modes are currently implemented: Sandbox mode allows the user to change the scenario attributes at will and Quiz mode which tests the user. The code is not pubically released, but there are some demonstrational videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfSijCg2jHYicy0-kQmMMn-tYInAoDbOZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
