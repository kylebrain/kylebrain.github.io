I primarily work with C-style languages, using C# and Unity for my previous work at the Evolutionary Computational Systems Labratory and other side projects, C++ for all course work, and C for my teaching fellow position. I worked at Intel using Python developing functional validation tests. I am familar with other web languages from side projects including SQL and frontend and backend Javascript frameworks.
