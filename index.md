I primarily work with C-style languages, using C# and Unity for my previous work at the Evolutionary Computational Systems Labratory and other side projects, C++ for all course work, and C for my teaching fellow position. I worked at Intel using Python developing functional validation tests. I am familar with other web languages from side projects including SQL and frontend and backend Javascript frameworks. Most recently, I worked as an intern for Ridgeline Apps using Python backend and ReactJS frontend and I will start working there full-time Summer 2021.
